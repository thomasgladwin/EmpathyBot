# EmpathyBot
My first little toy-model for exploring natural language processing.

Requires a copy of GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz in the working directory.

Run via: python EmoDetInteractive.py

And then tell it stuff!

(Or, assuming it's running on a server somewhere, tweet at it via: @tegladwin EmpathyBot XXX, replacing XXX with some text you want analyzed.)
